# Frozen Lava version 0.1.0

The screen displays (L)ives, (D)eaths, and (R)ound. When you beat the game,
you're rewarded with an extra life - and starting a new round. How many rounds
can you survive?

Controller is supported, with mappings to the standard Xbox 360 controller
scheme. Press ESC or START to pause, then Q to quit.

There are infinite rounds, but from round 6 onwards you die in one hit. At the
end of a round, you get an extra life.

The game utilizes an autosave feature with checkpoints. Progress is saved at
each checkpoint and the beginning of each round. The game resets when you run
out of lives (game over).

To fully reset this save data including high score and best time, press F9 at
any time while the game is not paused.

There's a secret for fans of DOOM to find, as well as one particularly useful
shortcut if you can manage glitch the game.

Thank you for playing! Any questions or comments, feel free to contact me:
